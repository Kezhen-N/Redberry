        <p>
            As this infamous pandemic took over the world,
             we adjusted our working practices so that our employees can be as safe
              and comfortable as possible. We have a hybrid work environment, 
              so you can either work from home or visit our lovely office on Sairme Street.
               If it was up to us, we would love you to see us in the office
                because we think face-to-face communications > Zoom meetings. 
                Both on the fun and productivity scales.
